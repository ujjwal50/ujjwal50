Let’s be honest:

It’s not exactly how i want to introduce myself.

That’s why you’re here.

Let me introduce myself.

“My name is uzwl. And I like cheese burst pizza.” Not great, right? (And it’s not exactly because of pineapple on a pizza.)

Truth is—

While this way to introduce myself may be funny to some, the vast majority will find it plain stupid.
